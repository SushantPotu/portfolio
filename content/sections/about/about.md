Hey there! I'm Sushant, an incoming freshman at at UNC Chapel Hill. I'm majoring in Computer Science and Statistics and Analytics.

I've worked with a number of different languages such as JavaScript, Java, Python, and HTML/CSS. My goal is to work on new projects that positively impact those around me while exploring new things so feel free to contact me about any opportunities!
